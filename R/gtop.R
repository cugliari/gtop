#' Reconciliate individual predictions using GTOP 
#'
#' Uses a Game Theory approach to reconciliate hierarchical 
#' time series predicitons 
#'   
#' In hierarchical time series forecasts, one predicts individuals
#' quantities and a global quantity. There exists a contraint that
#' matches the sum of the individual quantities to the global quantity.
#' However, forecasting models don't take into account this constraint.
#' 
#' With GTOP you can reconciliate bla bla bla
